# Bias Language Checker for Job Descriptions

This is a beginner project to analyze bias in job postings by checking for the presence of biased or inclusive language. It reflects my early steps into machine learning and responsible AI, especially around how language can unintentionally exclude or marginalize people.

## 🧠 Motivation

I’ve seen firsthand how language can include or erase people. Job postings often use words like “aggressive” or “rockstar,” which may unintentionally signal bias or discourage qualified candidates. My goal with this project is to start understanding how simple logic and keyword analysis can bring more awareness to that.

## 🔍 How It Works

- A small list of job posting snippets is analyzed for two sets of words:
  - **Biased words** (e.g., "aggressive", "rockstar", "young")
  - **Inclusive words** (e.g., "empathy", "diverse", "flexible")

- For each snippet, the script prints out which words match which category.

## 📂 Files

- `bias_word_checker.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the code.
- `README.md`: This file.

## 🛠️ Tools

- Python (no external libraries required)
- Runs easily in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

## 🌱 Future Ideas

- Use a larger dataset of job listings
- Refine word lists with NLP tools like spaCy or NLTK
- Move from keyword matching to semantic analysis or classification
